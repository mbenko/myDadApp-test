# myDadApp
When you can't be there in the morning to inject humor into the day, this app implements a couple API calls that return a joke of the day. Built as a demo of how to deliver an application in the cloud, myDadApp is a .NET Core 2.2 demo app that deploys to a resource group in Azure with a collection of settings that take advantage of being a cloud app.
